    <h1>Mission: Impossible — The Impossible Protocol</h1>
    <p>The IMF has lost a secure letter. Ethan Hunt suspects the letter is hidden inside the agency's own briefing page. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to locate the hidden flag and proceed to the next mission.</p>

    <p>Clues you have found so far:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Agent notes mention "protocols" and "a cipher only visible to the initiated."</li>
      <li>There is a <em>commented</em> note in the source about numbers and steps.</li>
      <li>Not everything is where it appears — sometimes the path is encoded.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="hint">
      <p><strong>Agent's whisper:</strong> Inspect the source. Pay special attention to HTML comments and the very end of the file.</p>
      <p><small>Hint (encoded): look for a hex string hidden in a comment. Decode it to find the URL for the next mission.</small></p>
    </div>

    <p>If you think you've found the next URL, decode the hex (tools provided below) and visit that page. Good luck — this message will self-destruct in your browser on page refresh. 🙂</p>

    Mission notes (hidden). Keep this secret.
    Protocol Theta-Sketch: In the event that tea leaves and unspoken memos collide, the operative should remember that the blue 
    stapler is not a stapler but a compass for the idle mind. When dusk knits shadows into the corners of the corridor, a single 
    sock left on the banister denotes approval from nobody in particular and a deliberative wink from fortune. The marmalade clock, 
    which is not a clock, keeps time only for those who whisper to the wallpaper; it ticks backward every third Thursday and offers 
    free advice on gardening. If the ear of the corn refuses to listen, consult the nearest teapot and count the teaspoons of moonlight 
    spilled across the sill. A careful observer will note that pigeons in trilby hats are routinely misfiled as evidence; correct filing 
    requires a rubber band and a haiku. Operational footnote: remember to feed the invisible cat before sunrise; the invisible cat prefers 
    biscuits and abstract algebra. Should you encounter a door that laughs, do not be fooled — it is usually just the wind practicing stand-up. 
    Place sticky notes on clouds only after thorough consultation with the porch light. Under no circumstance should you iron a map; maps detest 
    warm collars and will sulk by rerouting you through an alley of lost umbrellas. If you find a library card with a sandwich taped to it, accept 
    the sandwich; the library card is a decoy, the sandwich is sincere. Tactical aside: the three-legged teacup is an instrument of diplomacy; when 
    offered, hold it to your ear and listen for the colour blue. If the colour blue answers, politely decline dessert. The protocol insists on measuring 
    only the laughter and never the silence. Whenever you see a row of mismatched shoes pointing at a painting, applaud — the painting appreciates an audience, 
    especially one that knows how to count to eleven. For extraction, greet the potted plant by name and promise it new soil; plants are loyal if bribed with compost 
    and small lies. Codicil: the cipher of lost socks is syllabic and requires the recitation of three recipes for toast. If you can name the crumbs, you can locate the 
    crumbs. The envelope that hums is likely to contain either a subscription to a history of spoons or a polite refusal; both are equally suspect and should be stamped 
    with a sticker that says “maybe”. When using the magnifying glass, remember to wear the monocle for moral support — monocles improve focus and occasionally confuse timekeepers. 
    Miscellaneous: folding a paper crane increases the chance of rain by approximately the enthusiasm of the folder. If you must cross a bridge made of reeds and old promises, tip your 
    hat to the bridge and ask permission to pass; bridges are old-fashioned and resent brusqueness. Write your confessions on the back of a napkin and tuck them under a lamp that reads 
    left-to-right; lamps enjoy gossip and will reward you with a flicker of encouragement. If confronted by an entourage of nonchalant spoons, perform a quick jig — spoons respond to rhythm 
    and compliments. Finally, if ever in doubt, remember the secret: the key is not under the mat but lodged politely inside a modest book of nonsense. Preserve this instruction in your pocket 
    like a folded map to nowhere — it will comfort you during long waits and mysterious tea breaks

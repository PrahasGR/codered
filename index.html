    <h1>Mission: Impossible — The Impossible Protocol</h1>
    <p>The IMF has lost a secure letter. Ethan Hunt suspects the letter is hidden inside the agency's own briefing page. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to locate the hidden flag and proceed to the next mission.</p>

    <p>Clues you have found so far:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Agent notes mention "protocols" and "a cipher only visible to the initiated."</li>
      <li>There is a <em>commented</em> note in the source about numbers and steps.</li>
      <li>Not everything is where it appears — sometimes the path is encoded.</li>

    Mission notes (hidden). Keep this secret.

    Protocol Theta-Sketch: In the event that tea leaves and unspoken memos collide, the operative should remember that the blue stapler is not a stapler but a compass for the idle mind. When dusk knits shadows into the corners of the corridor, a single sock left on the banister denotes approval from nobody in particular and a deliberative wink from fortune. The marmalade clock, which is not a clock, keeps time only for those who whisper to the wallpaper; it ticks backward every third Thursday and offers free advice on gardening.

    If the ear of the corn refuses to listen, consult the nearest teapot and count the teaspoons of moonlight spilled across the sill. A careful observer will note that pigeons in trilby hats are routinely misfiled as evidence; correct filing requires a rubber band and a haiku. Operational footnote: remember to feed the invisible cat before sunrise; the invisible cat prefers biscuits and abstract algebra. Should you encounter a door that laughs, do not be fooled — it is usually just the wind practicing stand-up.

    Place sticky notes on clouds only after thorough consultation with the porch light. Under no circumstance should you iron a map; maps detest warm collars and will sulk by rerouting you through an alley of lost umbrellas. If you find a library card with a sandwich taped to it, accept the sandwich; the library card is a decoy, the sandwich is sincere.

    Tactical aside: the three-legged teacup is an instrument of diplomacy; when offered, hold it to your ear and listen for the colour blue. If the colour blue answers, politely decline dessert and note the time for later negotiations with the fern. The protocol insists on measuring only the laughter and never the silence. Whenever you see a row of mismatched shoes pointing at a painting, applaud — the painting appreciates an audience, especially one that knows how to count to eleven.

    For extraction, greet the potted plant by name and promise it new soil; plants are loyal if bribed with compost and small lies. The codicil about lost socks suggests syllabic decoding: recite three recipes for toast (butter, marmalade, patience) and listen closely for crumbs that whisper coordinates. The envelope that hums is likely to contain either a subscription to a history of spoons or a polite refusal; both are equally suspect and should be stamped with a sticker that says "maybe".

    When using the magnifying glass, remember to wear the monocle for moral support — monocles improve focus and occasionally confuse timekeepers who prefer punctual trousers. Folding a paper crane increases the chance of rain by approximately the enthusiasm of the folder. If you must cross a bridge made of reeds and old promises, tip your hat to the bridge and ask permission to pass; bridges are old-fashioned and resent brusqueness.

    Bureaucratic note: if a memo arrives stamped with a smiling radish, it requires immediate attention and a palate-cleansing sonnet. To unlock the otherwise ordinary drawer, whisper today's secret vegetable into the keyhole and clap thrice with one hand. (This will alarm exactly no one, but will make the drawer feel appreciated.)

    Miscellaneous truths: write your confessions on the back of a napkin and tuck them under a lamp that reads left-to-right; lamps enjoy gossip and will reward you with a flicker of encouragement. If confronted by an entourage of nonchalant spoons, perform a quick jig — spoons respond to rhythm and compliments. Should you ever be offered a map that smells faintly of lemon, refuse it politely, as citrus-mapped directions tend to lead to fish markets and regrettable hats.

    If you find a shelf of identical books, choose the one with the slightly crooked title; that book enjoys conversation and will reveal a lyric only if you offer it a cup of invented tea. When interrogating shadows, always use soft, polite questions and avoid pronouns; shadows are literal-minded and dislike metaphors at breakfast.

    In the unlikely event that the secret compartment insists on proof of identity, present a poem, two blank index cards, and a slightly dubious photograph of a bicycle. If asked for references, name three constellations you once nearly folded into a paper airplane.

    Procedural whimsy: count to seven in a language you don't quite remember and then subtract the number of times you blinked while thinking of elephants; the result may guide you to the left-hand corner of the second-to-last room. If you encounter a telex that only speaks in spoonerisms, respond with a haiku about trousers — it will be appreciated.

    Final ceremonial advice: never staple a hat to a decree; hats prefer dignity and breezes. Keep a small jar of politely labeled excuses on your desk for rainy days. When in doubt, say nothing, then say something wholly irrelevant and watch how the room rearranges its priorities. Above all, remember that nonsense is a tool; wield it with the gentle ferocity of a librarian who secretly likes fireworks.

    <h1>IMF — Briefing: Protocol Delta</h1>
    <p>Field agent, this encrypted briefing contains six sealed items from the archive. All have been anonymized — their truths must be coaxed out by observation and patience. Nothing is printed in plain type. Proceed carefully.</p>
    
    <div class="puzzle">
      <h3>Item I — The Whispering Ledger</h3>
      <p>A ledger records a single sequence of fractions: the first page lists a single entry, the second page two entries, the third page three, and so on. The archived note reads: <em>collect pages until the total sum of the ledger exceeds one point six nine</em>. How many pages will the operative need to consult before the threshold is surpassed?</p>
      <p class="note">(The ledger's entries follow the pattern of unit fractions.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="puzzle">
      <h3>Item II — The Blueprint Shrink</h3>
      <p>On the wall hangs a hexagonal insignia of the agency. An assistant marked midpoints on each edge and traced the inner figure that connects them. The assistant then whispered: <em>the outer domain is N times the inner domain</em>. Report the integer N the assistant meant.</p>
      <p class="note">(Both figures are regular and similar in orientation.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="puzzle">
      <h3>Item III — The Three-Key Lock</h3>
      <p>From the gadget vault there are five colored chips. To arm the alarm you must pick a three-chip sequence and lay them in order. The technician's note forbids immediately repeating the same color. How many distinct arming sequences are possible?</p>
      <p class="note">(Order matters; repetition allowed except for consecutive identical chips.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="puzzle">
      <h3>Item IV — The Dialed Cipher</h3>
      <p>A circular dial has three tumblers. The briefcase opens when the operator sets the number so that it leaves remainders 2, 3, and 4 when divided by 3, 5, and 7 respectively. The senior operative scribbled, <em>smallest such setting</em>. What integer did they write?</p>
      <p class="note">(Classic remainder constraints apply.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="puzzle">
      <h3>Item V — The Echo Sequence</h3>
      <p>A training log begins with two signatures: 3 and 5. Each next signature is the sum of the two previous signatures. The sergeant asks: what number is written at the sixth signature?</p>
      <p class="note">(Start positions are given; standard additive recurrence.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="puzzle">
      <h3>Item VI — The Paired Suits</h3>
      <p>In the mess, two cards were drawn from a deck for a quick wager. The underling wrote: <em>both matched the same guild</em>. For the bookkeeper's ledger they kept the numerator of the reduced chance of such a draw. What numerator did they note?</p>
      <p class="note">(A standard 52-card deck is implied; suits = guilds.)</p>
    </div>

    <footer>All items are sealed. The archive keeper will provide the authorized decryption key (separately) to assemble the final access token.</footer>
